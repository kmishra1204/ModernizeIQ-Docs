# Tutorial: SoundGan

SoundGan is a project that uses a **Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)** to create *new and unique audio* from scratch. It works by training two neural networks, a **Generator** and a **Discriminator**, in a competitive game. The Generator learns to produce *realistic audio spectrograms*, which are then converted into audible sound files, while the Discriminator learns to distinguish real audio from generated fakes. This allows users to either *train their own audio generation models* or *synthesize new sounds* using a pre-trained model.

# Tutorial: PocketFlow

PocketFlow is a **workflow framework** that helps you break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable units called *Nodes*. These nodes are then connected together to form *Flows*, which define the sequence of operations. It uses a *Shared State* to allow all nodes to communicate and pass data seamlessly, and supports both *synchronous and asynchronous processing* for efficient execution, including handling multiple items in *batches*.

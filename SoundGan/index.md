# Tutorial: SoundGan

SoundGan is a project that leverages **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)** to create *synthetic audio*. It functions by training two neural networks: a **Generator**, which learns to produce realistic audio spectrograms from random noise, and a **Discriminator**, acting as a critic to distinguish real spectrograms from those created by the Generator. Once trained, the system can utilize the **Generator** to produce new, unique audio files by converting the generated spectrograms into audible sound waveforms.
